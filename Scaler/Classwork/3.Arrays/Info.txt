                                  Arrays


->Given an array of size n with n-1 elements sorted.Now sort whole array  // Bubbling/search postion of last element and then insert by moving each element ahead
->Reverse Array with space complexity O(1)  							 //Can be done in O(N) time
->Reverse SubArray 														//Can be done in O(1) like above considering subarray and reversing
->Rotate the array in anticlock wise direction in k steps without an extra array in O(N)
              =>Best approach is to 123|45 we can reverse each partion and then whole array would be reversed
->How many elements which have both numbers strictly greater and smaller in O(N)
->Arrays Numbered from 1 to N except 1 element all are present Find missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space;
			  =>Using a boolean Array can be an option but it takes extra space
			  =>So we can use maths and find sum till N and then sum of given array and find differnce.
->Arrat size N with one number missing and one repeating find both repeating and missing number
			  =>Using count array is option which costs space
			  =>Best will to use maths again and get one equation as in above ques and other equation form squaring the sum equations
